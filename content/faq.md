# Arete Fellowship Announcement


### INTRODUCTION

Some efforts to improve the world can be much more impactful than others. Smallpox eradication, the abolitionist movement, development of germ theory, and the Green Revolution are just a few examples which illustrate what's possible when people come together to solve pressing problems. But those projects are few and far between. At the other end of the spectrum, many well-intended initiatives are ineffective or even counterproductive. Discerning between the good and bad is the perennial challenge every generation faces, and yet the coming century is poised to be the most consequential yet: how we maneuver such challenges over the next hundred years may drastically affect the trajectory of humankind.

EA UNC would like to invite applications for the Arete Fellowship, a selective new program that will offer an accelerated introduction to Effective Altruism (EA) for students who are highly motivated to think rationally about their potential to have a positive impact on the world. 

If the following interests you, please consider applying!

What is EA? EA is both a philosophy and a network of people, centered around the desire to find ways to do the most good possible given the world’s limited resources and our own limited time, energy, and talents. Having significant impact on the world seems like a privilege reserved for wealthy philanthropists or tech oligarchs, when in reality, with careful thinking one can find extraordinary opportunities to do good. 

We think something incredible is true: there are extraordinary opportunities to change the world that most people don’t realize exist. Consider that for a second. We think there are important insights that can enable rationally-minded people to increase their impact by many orders of magnitude.

So, EA is about doing the most good possible with limited resources, and it has two distinct components: 

The EA philosophy tries to use reason and evidence to work out how to have the greatest impact.
The EA network is the group of people who share this mission, many of whom have organized their careers around doing good, among whom methods and practical wisdom (which now constitute a considerable literature) are shared.

The Arete Fellowship offers a deep, semester-long dive into the Effective Altruism movement. 

### Why should you care? 

EA is multifaceted, so its principles have different consequences for different individuals; each of us has unique interests and skills to offer. Given limited time, EA UNC is looking to invest significant time in a small number of individuals, keen to learn how they can have a significant impact on society with their lives and careers (which turns out to be both rarer and easier than most people think!).
This is not an introduction to the infrastructures of philanthropy, university policy or foreign aid, nor is this a course in activism. Our objective is to change the way you think about philanthropy and impact, and to help you leverage your own skills and interests—whether you’re a computer wizard, legal buff, biohacker or policy wonk—to solve problems that can improve, or even save, the lives of hundreds of people around the world (problems often neglected by traditional philanthropy).
The organizers of EA UNC are majoring and minoring in computer science, biology, statistics, mathematics, philosophy, political science, economics, neuroscience and more. The Fellowship will plug you in to a network of people from diverse backgrounds and interests—both at UNC and beyond—who share the same ambition to do good better. Please join us!


### Fellowship structure

The Fellowship takes place over the course of 9 weeks. Each week consists of a set of study resources and a class seminar. The resources take approximately one hour to complete and must be finished in preparation for the weekly discussion. Additionally, Fellows will be able to schedule a time for 1-on-1 career consulting anytime after week 3, though such consultation may be most valuable after week 7. All of this is flexible.

### Expectations

We expect fellows to embody these four traits:
Enthusiasm to do good better
Openness to novel ideas
A scientific mindset
Action orientation

A central part of the EA mindset is taking seriously ideas that may seem counterintuitive or even uncomfortable. Some of the most exciting opportunities to do good exist precisely because they are not mainstream and remain unexploited. As such, fellows should expect to have their beliefs and plans challenged.

During the Fellowship we will cover a wide range of fields and methodologies. No subject knowledge is required — the program is designed to be self-contained, so fellows should not worry if they are not familiar with, say, philosophy, economics, synthetic biology, or artificial intelligence. EA is cerebral in some ways, but this Fellowship is not just a fun intellectual exercise — we hope fellows will be eager to incorporate these ideas into their daily lives and long-term plans. We hope you will find the ideas persuasive enough.

UNC EA’s limited resources include time; we expect Fellows to make the most of it. Participants should treat the Fellowship like a one-credit course with one hour of homework and an hour and a half of “class-time” per week. To complete the Fellowship, fellows must also write a 400-500 word blog post for UNC Effective Altruism on a topic of their choice.

### Attendance

Fellows must complete materials and attend meetings weekly. If a fellow cannot attend a meeting, they should let EA UNC organizers know beforehand, and we will try to set up another time to discuss the week’s materials 1-on-1.
Upon Completion of the Fellowship
Fellows may list the Fellowship on their résumé or CV, and are invited to join Effective Altruism UNC. Additionally, all Arete alumni can request a peer reference or letter of recommendation from their Fellowship leaders at any time and are encouraged to take advantage of this. Fellowship leaders are dedicated to helping alumni have the opportunities that will make them more effective altruists throughout their lives.

### Curriculum

The Fellowship takes place over 9 weeks. Weeks 1-7 and 9 have a set curriculum and week 8 is a discussion of Fellow-submitted topics.
